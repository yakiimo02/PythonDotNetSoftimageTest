A simple test of running Python.NET inside of Softimage.

Made possible by the information in the tutorial http://tech-artists.org/wiki/PythonNetInMaya
Additional helpful reference http://shaderop.com/2011/04/using-wxpython-with-autodesk-softimage/

Code:
The PythonDotNetTest folder contains the C# .NET WinForm control. DotNetTestSoftimage.py and DotNetTestSoftimageModeless.py 
are the Softimage self-installing plugin scripts.

Install:
1) Installing Python.NET binaries.
Download the Python.NET from its sourceforge repository. http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/
A binary file zip can be downloaded, but for my tests I compiled "Any CPU" and "x64" binaries from source. 
Copy Python.Runtime.dll and clr.pyd into the Softimage bin folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2012\bin).
2) Compile the PythonDotNetTest C# .NET WinForm Control and modify DotNetTestMaya.py to point to the compiled 
PythonDotNetTest.dll folder path.
3) Copy DotNetTestSoftimage.py and DotNetTestSoftimageModeless.py to the Softimage Plugins folder.
